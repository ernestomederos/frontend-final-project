        description: "Once (Havana, Cuba) is a composer, singer, and music producer based in Berlin. As a former rocker, he blends mainstream rhythms with a particular sensitivity that he calls #PerreoConFundamento. At 32 years old, he still dreams of hearing his music in a nightclub and collaborating with Yandel before he retires. For now, Once is not thinking about retirement."

        description: "«Mora» is a song about female selectivity, the archetype of the unattainable woman that triggers a sense of male inadequacy and channels the persistence of self-improvement, paradigm shift, and ascent in the status quo. In «Mora», the man is the object of female seduction: a song to fall in love and dance sensually.",
